-----------------
The files are:
WRI_500-GEO.HTM: metadata summary.
WRI_500-GEO.JPG: subsidiary file required for correct display of metadata summary.
SA.JPG: subsidiary file required for correct display of metadata summary.
METADATA.XML: metadata generated in ESRI xml format.
QAT4QAT8.TXT: lookup table for conversion from South African to USGS-style quaternary codes.
(mainly of interest to ESA BASINS users).
WRIALL500.AVL: legend file for ArcView 3.x - line width proportional to Strahler order.
-----------------
WRIALL500.PRJ: ESRI projection definition file.
WRIALL500.SHP.XML: ESRI metadata file.
WRIALL500.SHP, WRIALL500.SHX, WRIALL500.DBF: ESRI shape file components.
The shape file contains the South African 1:500 000 river coverage
for drainage region(s) ALL, in the Cape Datum, geographical coordinates.
(All editing occurred in Albers Equal Area projection for exact tolerance setting.)
(The data is being kept in its original datum until a standard datum-shift to
Hartebeesthoek94 or WGS84 is agreed upon, to avoid inadvertent data corruption.)
The fields may include:

.  ---------------
(1) INTERNAL FIELDS (ignore)
.  ===============
SHAPE, FNODE_,TNODE_, LPOLY_, RPOLY_, LENGTH, TMPRIV_, TMPRIV_ID.

(2) ATTRIBUTES (sequence may differ)
.   ==========
NAME: generally, the name assigned to the reach on a topographical map
- sometimes the correctness is uncertain.
- ALIAS: alternate name or names for the reach, separated by \.
- RIVN_ROOT: For multilingual annotation purposes (prototype): the root of the river name.
- RIVN_SUFX: The qualifier of the river name, e.g. river, spruit, loop.
CLASS: unreliable indicator of seasonality of river flow. The classes and allocation require review:
- Dry=dry river, Perennial=perennial river, Non=non-perennial river,
Unknown=not present in original coverage or not transferred from source map.
PRIMARY: primary drainage region where the reach occurs.
- a lower-case letter indicates a pseudo drainage region outside South Africa.
ORDER: Strahler order, starting from source=1.
END: S=Source, N=iNtermediate, M=Mouth, E=Endorheic.
REACHCODE: 10-character reach code made up as follows:
- 1 to 4: quaternary drainage region in which MOST of the river falls.
(Note that USA programs such as BASINS expect eight numerical digits.
The qat4qat8.txt lookup table contains the appropriate DWA to USA conversions.)
- 5 to 6: arbitrary sequence number of the reaches within a quaternary drainage region.
- 7 to 10: four zeroes (0000) in the 1:500 000 coverage, intended for later use at more detailed scale.
SORTER: internal sorting field - always increases downstream in river network
LENGTH_KM:  length of reach in kilometres (not to be confused with the meaningless LENGTH field).
RivEX fields:  (see http://www.rivex.co.uk/)
- SEGMENT : Channel identifier.
- STRAHLER:  Horton-Strahler order.
- SHREVE:  Shreve order.
- US_ACCUM: Accumulated upstream metres at the lower node of each arc.
- LINK_TYPE : same idea as the "END" field, above. E=Exterior, I=Interior, O=Outlet.
- CATCHID:  Automatically generated ID for each end node (i.e. when END='E' or 'M').
- DIST2MTH : Distance to the mouth in metres from the upper node of each arc.
- MAINCHAN : Main channel identifier.
- CATCHID : drainage region identifier.
