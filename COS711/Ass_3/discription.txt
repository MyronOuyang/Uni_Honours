Predict future soil moisture, framing the problem as "Predicting the soil moisture for the current timestamp based on previous data".
Data is prepared by imputing missing values, normilizing via MinMax between 0 and 1. Enhancing the data inputed by having additional "Future value columns"
Model is trained using LSTM recurrent neural network
Parameters are optimized using Sobol numbers
Cross validation used along with Root Mean Squared Error is used to determine the performance of the model
Mean Absolute error used for Loss function
Gradient Descent is used as optimization function
